# Getting Started with Amazon Redshift<a name="getting-started"></a>

 Welcome to the *Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide*\. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte\-scale data warehouse service in the cloud\. An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a collection of computing resources called *nodes*, which are organized into a group called a *cluster*\. Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases\. 

 If you are a first\-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections:

+ [Amazon Redshift Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/) \(*this guide*\) – This guide provides a tutorial of using Amazon Redshift to create a sample cluster and work with sample data\.

If you are building a proof\-of\-concept solution with Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you read [Building a Proof of Concept for Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/proof-of-concept-playbook.html)\.

 This guide is a tutorial designed to walk you through the process of creating a sample Amazon Redshift cluster\. You can use this sample cluster to evaluate the Amazon Redshift service\. In this tutorial, you perform the following steps:  
+ [Step 1: Set Up Prerequisites](rs-gsg-prereq.md)
+ [Step 2: Create an IAM Role](rs-gsg-create-an-iam-role.md)

+ [Step 4: Authorize Access to the Cluster](rs-gsg-authorize-cluster-access.md)
+ [Step 5: Connect to the Sample Cluster and Run Queries](rs-gsg-connect-to-cluster.md)
+ [Step 6: Load Sample Data from Amazon S3](rs-gsg-create-sample-db.md)
+ [Step 7: Find Additional Resources and Reset Your Environment](rs-gsg-clean-up-tasks.md)
