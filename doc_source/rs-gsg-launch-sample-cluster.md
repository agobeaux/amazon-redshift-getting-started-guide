# Step 2: Create a sample Amazon Redshift cluster<a name="rs-gsg-launch-sample-cluster"></a>

Now that you have the prerequisites completed, you can launch your Amazon Redshift cluster\.

The cluster that you are about to create is live \(and not running in a sandbox\)\. You incur the standard Amazon Redshift usage fees for the cluster until you delete it\. If you complete the tutorial described here in one sitting and delete the cluster when you are finished, the total charges are minimal\.

**To create an Amazon Redshift cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.
**Important**  
If you use IAM user credentials, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the cluster operations\. For more information, see [Controlling access to IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/iam-redshift-user-mgmt.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

1. At upper right, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create the cluster\. 

1. On the navigation menu, choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose **Create cluster**\. The **Create cluster** page appears\.

1. In the **Cluster configuration** section, specify values for **Cluster identifier**, **Node type**, and **Nodes**: 
   + **Cluster identifier**: Enter **examplecluster** for this tutorial\. This identifier must be unique\. The identifier must be from 1–63 characters using as valid characters a–z \(lowercase only\) and \- \(hyphen\)\. 
   + Choose one of the following methods to size your cluster:
**Note**  
The following step describes an Amazon Redshift console that is running in an AWS Region that supports RA3 node types\. For a list of AWS Regions that support RA3 node types, see [Overview of RA3 node types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#rs-ra3-node-types) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.
     + If your AWS Region supports RA3 node types, choose either **Production** or **Free trial** to answer the question **What are you planning to use this cluster for?** 

       When you choose **Production**, do one of the following:

       If your organization is eligible, you might be able to create a cluster under the Amazon Redshift free trial program\. For information about creating clusters using the free trial program, see [Using a sample dataset](sample-data-load.md)\. To do this, choose **Free trial** to create a configuration with the dc2\.large node type\. For more information about choosing a free trial, see [Amazon Redshift free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/free-trial/)\. 
     + If you don't know how large to size your cluster, choose **Help me choose**\. Doing this starts a sizing calculator that asks you questions about the size and query characteristics of the data that you plan to store in your data warehouse\. 

       If you know the required size of your cluster \(that is, the node type and number of nodes\), choose **I'll choose**\. Then choose the **Node type** and number of **Nodes** to size your cluster for the proof of concept\.
   + Choose **Node type**: **dc2\.large** with **Nodes**: **2** for this tutorial\.
   + If you have chosen **Production** for your cluster, then do one of the following:
     + To use the sample dataset Amazon Redshift provides, in **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data**\. Amazon Redshift loads the sample dataset Tickit to the default `dev` database and `public` schema\.
     + To bring your own data to Amazon Redshift, continue with the rest of the tutorial\.

1. In the **Database configuration** section, specify values for **Database name \(optional\)**, **Database port \(optional\)**, **Admin user name**, and **Admin user password**\. Or choose **Generate password** to use a password generated by Amazon Redshift\.

   In this tutorial, use these values:
   + **Database name \(optional\)**: Enter **dev**\.
   + **Database port \(optional\)**: Enter **5439**\.
   + **Admin user name**: Enter **awsuser**\.
   + **Admin user password**: Enter a value for the password\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Cluster permissions** section, for **Available IAM roles** choose the IAM role that you previously created, **myRedshiftRole**\. Then choose **Associate IAM role**\. 

   If you created your cluster with the **Load sample data** option, associate an IAM role to the cluster\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Additional configurations** section, turn off **Use defaults** to modify **Network and security**, **Database configuration**, **Maintenance**, **Monitoring**, and **Backup** settings\.

1. Choose **Create cluster**\.
