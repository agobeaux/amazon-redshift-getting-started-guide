# Step 2: Create a sample Amazon Redshift cluster<a name="rs-gsg-launch-sample-cluster"></a>

After you have the prerequisites completed, you can launch an Amazon Redshift cluster\.

The cluster that you are about to create is live \(and not running in a sandbox\)\. You incur the standard Amazon Redshift usage fees for the cluster until you delete it\. If you complete the tutorial described here in one sitting and delete the cluster when you are finished, the total charges are minimal\. 

**To create an Amazon Redshift cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.
**Important**  
If you use IAM user credentials, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform the cluster operations\. For more information, see [Controlling access to IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/iam-redshift-user-mgmt.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

1. At upper right, choose the AWS Region where you want to create the cluster\. 

1. On the navigation menu, choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose **Create cluster**\. The **Create cluster** page appears\.

1. In the **Cluster configuration** section, specify values for **Cluster identifier**, **Node type**, **Nodes**, and how you plan to use the cluster: 
   + **For Cluster identifier**, enter **examplecluster** for this tutorial\. This identifier must be unique\. The identifier must be from 1–63 characters using as valid characters a–z \(lowercase only\) and \- \(hyphen\)\. 
   + To answer the question **What are you planning to use this cluster for?** choose **Free trial** or **Production**: 
     + **Free trial** – If your organization is eligible, you might be able to create a cluster under the Amazon Redshift free trial program\. For information about creating clusters using the free trial program, see [Using a sample dataset](sample-data-load.md)\. 

       To do this, choose **Free trial** to create a configuration with the dc2\.large node type\. For more information about choosing a free trial, see [Amazon Redshift free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/free-trial/)\. 
     + **Production** – For production use, you have two options:

       Choose **Help me choose** if you don't know how large to size your cluster\. Doing this starts a sizing calculator that asks you questions about the size and query characteristics of the data that you plan to store in your data warehouse\. 

       Choose **I'll choose** if you know the required size of your cluster \(that is, the node type and number of nodes\)\. Then choose a **Node type** value and number for **Nodes** to size your cluster\.
   + Choose **Node type**: **dc2\.large** with **Nodes**: **2** for this tutorial\.
   + If you have chosen **Production** for your cluster, then do one of the following:
     + To use the sample dataset that Amazon Redshift provides, in **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data**\. Amazon Redshift loads the sample dataset Tickit to the default `dev` database and `public` schema\.
     + To bring your own data to Amazon Redshift, continue with the rest of the tutorial\.

1. In the **Database configuration** section, specify values for **Database name \(optional\)**, **Database port \(optional\)**, **Admin user name**, and **Admin user password**\. Or choose **Generate password** to use a password generated by Amazon Redshift\.

   In this tutorial, use these values:
   + **Database name \(optional\)**: Enter **dev**\.
   + **Database port \(optional\)**: Enter **5439**\.
   + **Admin user name**: Enter **awsuser**\.
   + **Admin user password**: Enter a value for the password\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Cluster permissions** section, for **Available IAM roles** choose the IAM role that you previously created, **myRedshiftRole**\. Then choose **Associate IAM role**\. 

   If you created your cluster with the **Load sample data** option, associate an IAM role to the cluster\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Additional configurations** section, turn off **Use defaults** to modify **Network and security**, **Database configuration**, **Maintenance**, **Monitoring**, and **Backup** settings\.

   If you create your cluster with the **Load sample data** option and want to turn on enhanced Amazon VPC routing, the cluster in your Amazon VPC requires access to the Amazon S3 endpoint in order for data to be loaded\. You can make the cluster publicly accessible, configure a NAT in your Amazon VPC for the cluster to access the internet, or configure a Amazon S3 VPCE in your Amazon VPC\. For more information about enhanced Amazon VPC routing, see [Enabling enhanced Amazon VPC routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-enabling-cluster.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

1. Choose **Create cluster**\.
