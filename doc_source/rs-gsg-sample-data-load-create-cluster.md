# Step 1: Create an Amazon Redshift cluster<a name="rs-gsg-sample-data-load-create-cluster"></a>

Now that you have the prerequisites completed, you can start creating your Amazon Redshift cluster\.

## <a name="create-cluster-sample"></a>

**To create an Amazon Redshift cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\.

1. To create a cluster, do one of the following:
   + On the Amazon Redshift service page, choose **Create cluster**\. The Create cluster page appears\.
   + On the [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/), choose **DASHBOARD**, then choose **Create cluster**\.
   + On the [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/redshift/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/), choose **CLUSTERS**, then choose **Create cluster**\.

1. In the **Cluster configuration** section, specify a **Cluster identifier**\. This identifier must be unique\. The identifier must be from 1–63 characters using as valid characters a–z \(lowercase only\) and \- \(hyphen\)\. 

   Enter **examplecluster** for this tutorial\.

1. If your organization is eligible, you might be able to create a cluster under the Amazon Redshift free trial program\. To do this, choose **Free trial** to create a configuration with the dc2\.large node type\. For more information about choosing a free trial, see [Amazon Redshift free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/free-trial/)\. 

   The console displays your selection, as shown in the example following\.  
![\[Console showing selection of a free trial\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/images/free-trial.png)

   If you then choose another node type, your organization won't be eligible for the free trial\. 

   After you choose your node type, do one of the following:
   + In **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data** to load the sample dataset to your Amazon Redshift cluster\. Amazon Redshift loads the sample dataset Tickit to the default `dev` database and `public` schema\. You can start using the query editor to query data\. 
   + To bring your own data to your Amazon Redshift cluster, choose **Production**\. Then in **Sample data**, choose **Load sample data**\. For information about bringing your own data, see [Bringing your own data to Amazon Redshift](bring-own-data.md)\.

   Amazon Redshift automatically loads the sample dataset to your sample Amazon Redshift cluster\.

1. In the **Database configuration** section, specify values for **Admin user name** and **Admin user password**\. Or choose **Generate password** to use a password generated by Amazon Redshift\.

   For this tutorial, use these values:
   + **Admin user name**: Enter **awsuser**\.
   + **Admin user password**: Enter a value for the password\.

1. Choose **Create cluster**\. 

This tutorial uses the Amazon Redshift query editor, which you can use to query data immediately as Amazon Redshift connects your new cluster to the query editor during cluster creation\. Cluster creation might take a few minutes to complete\. After creation completes, the cluster status becomes ACTIVE\.

When Amazon Redshift is creating your Amazon Redshift cluster with the load sample data option, it automatically uploads the sample dataset Tickit\. Go to the query editor and view the sample Tickit tables by choosing the `dev` database and `public` schema\.

You can also choose other SQL client tools that support JDBC or ODBC drivers to work with data in your cluster\. For more information, see [Connecting to an Amazon Redshift cluster using SQL client tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-to-cluster.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.
